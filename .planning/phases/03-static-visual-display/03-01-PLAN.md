<objective>
Create pixel art assets for room backgrounds and avatar as inline TypeScript modules.

Purpose: All visual rendering in the card depends on having pixel art assets. Using inline data (SVG strings) avoids HACS resource loading issues and keeps the bundle self-contained.
Output: Two TypeScript modules exporting room background SVGs and avatar sprite SVG that the card renderer can import directly.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create room background pixel art assets</name>
  <files>src/assets/rooms.ts</files>
  <action>
Create `src/assets/rooms.ts` that exports a `roomBackgrounds` object mapping room IDs to inline SVG strings.

Each room background should be a pixel art style SVG (approximately 320x200 viewBox) with simple geometric shapes representing:

1. **office** - Desk with monitor, office chair, bookshelf, window with light. Color palette: blues, browns, warm wood tones.
2. **kitchen** - Counter/stove, cabinets, fridge, small window. Color palette: warm whites, greens, silver/gray appliances.
3. **living_room** - Couch, TV/entertainment center, coffee table, lamp. Color palette: warm browns, soft reds/oranges, cozy tones.
4. **bedroom** - Bed with pillows/blanket, nightstand with lamp, dresser, window with curtains. Color palette: soft blues, purples, calming tones.

Implementation approach:
- Use SVG `<rect>` elements with `shape-rendering="crispEdges"` for pixel art look
- Each SVG should be a complete self-contained string (no external references)
- Use a consistent 320x200 viewBox for all rooms
- Include a floor and wall background in each room
- Keep shapes simple and blocky (pixel art aesthetic) — 8-16px grid alignment
- Export as: `export const roomBackgrounds: Record<string, string> = { office: '...', kitchen: '...', living_room: '...', bedroom: '...' };`

The SVGs should be recognizable as their respective rooms but don't need to be masterpieces — they're v1 placeholders that can be improved later. Prioritize being identifiable over being beautiful.

IMPORTANT: These are inline SVG strings, NOT separate .svg files. This avoids all HACS resource path issues. The strings will be used as `src` attributes on `<img>` tags via data URIs, or injected directly as innerHTML.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify the module exports correctly with no type errors. Visually inspect that each SVG string is well-formed XML.</verify>
  <done>Four room backgrounds exist as inline SVG strings in src/assets/rooms.ts, each recognizable as its respective room with pixel art style.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create avatar sprite pixel art asset</name>
  <files>src/assets/avatar.ts</files>
  <action>
Create `src/assets/avatar.ts` that exports avatar sprite data.

The avatar should be a simple pixel art character (approximately 32x48 pixels in the SVG, scaled up with crispEdges rendering). Design a cute, simple character:

- Standing idle pose facing forward
- Simple body: head, torso, legs (like a retro RPG character)
- Use bright, distinct colors that stand out against all room backgrounds
- Include a small shadow/ground indicator beneath the character

Export structure:
```typescript
export const avatarSprite = {
  idle: string,  // SVG string of idle pose
  width: 32,     // logical width in pixels
  height: 48,    // logical height in pixels
};
```

The idle SVG should use the same `shape-rendering="crispEdges"` for consistency with room backgrounds. Use a viewBox of "0 0 32 48" so it scales cleanly.

This is the static idle sprite only. Phase 4 (Animation System) will add walking frames and room-specific poses. For now, one single idle pose is sufficient.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify the module exports correctly. Verify the SVG string is valid XML with proper viewBox.</verify>
  <done>Avatar sprite exists as inline SVG string in src/assets/avatar.ts with idle pose, width, and height properties.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors
- Both asset files exist and export the expected types
- SVG strings are well-formed (opening `<svg` and closing `</svg>` tags present)
- Each room background has a distinct color palette and recognizable furniture
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Four room backgrounds (office, kitchen, living_room, bedroom) as inline SVG strings
- One avatar idle sprite as inline SVG string with dimensions
- All assets use pixel art style with crispEdges rendering
- TypeScript compiles without errors
</success_criteria>
